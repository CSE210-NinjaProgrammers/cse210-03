# Jumper
There are old skydivers and bold skydivers,
but there are no old, bold skydivers.

Jumper is a game in which the YOU(player) seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of 
a secret word one a time. If you guess the letter wrong, parts of your parachute gets erase. 
Remember it much more safer to jump and land using a full parachute. Have fun!
